/**
The Gift Wrapper
Did you know that there's also monetary inflation at the North Pole? You betcha, there is. And after 200+ years without a pay raise, Santa's elves are beginning to discuss a general strike.

December 3rd is just about the worst time imaginable for such a strike, and Santa's desperate to calm the elves down. If he can just wrap a few presents, maybe the elves will forget that they're being paid well below market rate (don't worry: the North Pole's actually still a Deleware-based startup so therefore it's ok).

There's a GiftWrapper type to help keep the wrapping process organized, but it needs something... it needs some way to be parameterized. What we have so far is nice as a generic (*wink wink*) starting point... but it needs some way to provide specific values for Present, From, and To at the type layer..

Please help! Otherwise the reindeer might catch wind of this and start a strike of their own in solidarity with the elves!
