Is Santa Dyslexic?
[it's early Saturday morning and the team has been working overtime. Santa storms into the factory floor shouting..]

[Santa] Don't you elves take any pride in your work?!?! Others would love to have your job for much less pay! I asked for a simple type that will reverse strings!! How hard is that?!? What do we even pay you for??

[unfortunately, Santa is conveniently forgetting that the Reverse type was cut from the sprint (which... of course... he agreed to)]

[floor manager] Ok. We never got acceptance criteria for that ticket.

[Santa] How difficult is it to understand what Reverse does!? 'rehsaD' should be transformed into 'Dasher', 'recnaD' should be transformed into 'Dancer', 'recnarP' should be transformed into 'Prancer'.. DO I NEED TO KEEP GOING?

[floor manager] Well you might be surprised. For example, what should happen to multi-codepoint unicode characters?

[Santa] What are you on about with all that accessibility stuff again!

[floor manager] Accessibility is important, sir.

[Santa] Look, this is just an MVP. We can add accessibility later. Just get me my Reverse type! I'm having a hard time reading this stuff otherwise!

## Question

```ts
import { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

type test_0_actual = Reverse<"rehsaD">;
//   ^?
type test_0_expected = "Dasher";
type test_0 = Expect<Equal<test_0_expected, test_0_actual>>;

type test_1_actual = Reverse<"recnaD">;
//   ^?
type test_1_expected = "Dancer";
type test_1 = Expect<Equal<test_1_expected, test_1_actual>>;

type test_2_actual = Reverse<"recnarP">;
//   ^?
type test_2_expected = "Prancer";
type test_2 = Expect<Equal<test_2_expected, test_2_actual>>;

type test_3_actual = Reverse<"nexiV">;
//   ^?
type test_3_expected = "Vixen";
type test_3 = Expect<Equal<test_3_expected, test_3_actual>>;

type test_4_actual = Reverse<"temoC">;
//   ^?
type test_4_expected = "Comet";
type test_4 = Expect<Equal<test_4_expected, test_4_actual>>;

type test_5_actual = Reverse<"dipuC">;
//   ^?
type test_5_expected = "Cupid";
type test_5 = Expect<Equal<test_5_expected, test_5_actual>>;

type test_6_actual = Reverse<"rennoD">;
//   ^?
type test_6_expected = "Donner";
type test_6 = Expect<Equal<test_6_expected, test_6_actual>>;

type test_7_actual = Reverse<"neztilB">;
//   ^?
type test_7_expected = "Blitzen";
type test_7 = Expect<Equal<test_7_expected, test_7_actual>>;

type test_8_actual = Reverse<"hploduR">;
//   ^?
type test_8_expected = "Rudolph";
type test_8 = Expect<Equal<test_8_expected, test_8_actual>>;
```

## Solution

> 在问题8的基础上,增加了递归的用法,用`infer`来获取字符串的第一个字符并继续处理剩余字符串,直至处理完所有的字符

```ts
/** 将一个字符串的所有字符都替换成`0` */
type CharToZero<T extends string,Ret extends string = ''> = T extends `${infer _}${infer Rest}`?CharToZero<Rest,`0${Ret}`>:Ret;
/** type Lodash = "0000" */
type Lodash = CharToZero<"hplo">;
```



```ts
type Reverse<
  S extends String,
  Ret extends string = ""
> = S extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
  ? Reverse<Rest, `${First}${Ret}`>
  : Ret;
```
